The goal of this project is to set up a Github repository

### Notes

* It's not necessary to use Github - you can use Gitlab, Bitbucket or host your own Git server but it's the easiest way to get set up here.

* If you can deploy your code and create a live demo, that's even better! But at minimum, always share your public code 



## Requirements

1. Learn how to set up a [Github profile and how to create a public Git repository](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)



2. [Learn some basic Git commands](https://www.w3schools.com/git/) like how to push code to your public repository. This will make doing the rest of this entire roadmap much easier



3. Learn about [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)



4. Create a public repository and share that link in the ""Track Your Progress"" section

For this skill, you will need to build an application using NodeJS which can convert Dollars into Cents","What is NodeJS,A NodeJS tutorial,Advanced Topics with NodeJS","REST,Backend,NodeJS","# Dollars To Cents

Converting dollars to cents would enable you to practice your fundamental knowledge of programming. Loops, if conditions and a simple algorithm will be used.

Your task is to create a RESTful API which has two endpoints: /dollar and /cents. The user can hit the /dollar endpoint with a dollar value (float), assuming that it can also accept extra cents (ex. $2.75), and convert it into an integer (in this case, if $2.75 = 275). After this, convert into coins with the sub-type of dollars: penny, nickel, dime and quarter. This should be returned to the user in a JSON format.

Use an algorithm that would divide the dollar value to the four coin types, and output few coins as possible.

(EX. If you have $0.58, I would have 4 coins: 2 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel and 3 pennies)

## Constraints
You might have done this task in the JavaScript section. That required you to use vanilla JS. You *must* use NodeJS for this

## Requirements

* There should be one endpoint: /dollar
* User can send a dollar value to the /dollar endpoint 
* User can see the total cents from the converted dollar value in the form of JSON

Using CSS Frameworks,qss0rClyxL8l6p,1,Dynamic Variables,1 day - 1 week,Full Stack ,Practice,#72A8FF,"CSS variables are a powerful tool that lets the developer associate a symbolic name with a value, and then use that name in the stylesheet wherever that value is required. 

In this project, you will learn to use CSS variables.","What is CSS,What are the best CSS Frameworks for React?,Material UI tutorial","NodeJS,React,Front End,CSS","# Dynamic CSS Variables

CSS variables are a powerful tool that lets the developer associate a symbolic name with a value, and then use that name in the stylesheet wherever that value is required. The advantage is that when a change to that value is  required it only needs to change in the CSS variable definition rather than in
the many spots it may be used.

What can make this even more powerful is to dynamically change the value of a
CSS variable at runtime.

The goal of this app is to dynamically change the background color of text boxes
based to let you gain experience using both CSS variables and dynamically 
changing them from within the app.

## Requirements
* User can see three two boxes to be used to enter a User ID and Password
along with 'Cancel' and 'Login' buttons underneath them. The default background
color of the text boxes is white.
* User can enter a user id and password into the text boxes.
* User can click the 'Login' button to validate the user id and password.
* User can see a warning message if one or both of the text boxes contains
spaces and the background color of the empty text box will change to light
yellow.
* User can see a warning message if the user id doesn't match 'testuser'
and the background color of the text box will change to light red.
* User can see a warning message if the password doesn't match 'mypassword'
and the background color of the text box will change to light red.
* User can click the 'Cancel' button to clear the text boxes and reset
their background colors to white.

## Bonus features

* User can see the color of the text box border change when an error is
detected
* User can see the size and font of the contents of the text box change
when an error is detected.

Working with Raw Data,rMWZdDg2bPV3n0,1,Enron Data Set,1 week - 1 month,Data Science,Practice,#FF7373,"A lot of data in a production environment isn't clean and needs processing before it can be used. 
You will need to develop the skill to deal with this kind of data. 

The project here is to use the Enron Dataset is a beginner friendly dataset for Natural Language processing. It consists of 500K+ emails sent by employees, most who are senior. ",,"NLP,Unsupervised Learning,Classification","# Raw data with Enron Email Dataset
  
Enron Dataset is a beginner friendly dataset for Natural Language processing. However, the catch here is that the data isn't as clean as the 
data sets you would've used in previous assignments. The data will need to be cleaned, massaged and prepared to be worked with before it can
be used for training.

Your objective is to prepare the data, and then using NLP, identify fraud.

### Notes
  
* This dataset consists of 500K+ emails sent by employees, most who are senior. 
* You don't need to use NLP - you can use k-means clustering to detect fraudulent activities from the contents of the emails
* Use NLP architectures to analyse the emails and draw insights. 

## Requirements
  
* Load, clean and prepare the data so it can be worked with. Hey - real data is nothing like Kaggle!
* Develop a model which can be used for fraud detection using this dataset.
* Your source code and model should be available for the public
  
## Useful links and resources

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/)

CSS variables are a powerful tool that lets the developer associate a symbolic
name with a value, and then use that name in the stylesheet wherever that
value is required. The advantage is that when a change to that value is 
required it only needs to change in the CSS variable definition rather than in
the many spots it may be used.

What can make this even more powerful is to dynamically change the value of a
CSS variable at runtime.

The goal of this app is to dynamically change the background color of text boxes
based to let you gain experience using both CSS variables and dynamically 
changing them from within the app.

## Requirements
* User can see three two boxes to be used to enter a User ID and Password
along with 'Cancel' and 'Login' buttons underneath them. The default background
color of the text boxes is white.
* User can enter a user id and password into the text boxes.
* User can click the 'Login' button to validate the user id and password.
* User can see a warning message if one or both of the text boxes contains
spaces and the background color of the empty text box will change to light
yellow.
* User can see a warning message if the user id doesn't match 'testuser'
and the background color of the text box will change to light red.
* User can see a warning message if the password doesn't match 'mypassword'
and the background color of the text box will change to light red.
* User can click the 'Cancel' button to clear the text boxes and reset
their background colors to white.

## Bonus features

* User can see the color of the text box border change when an error is
detected
* User can see the size and font of the contents of the text box change
when an error is detected.

The humble gatekeeper to any website is the Sign Up form. It is also one of the most critical parts of the website. Understandably, people who create websites want people to sign up to them so it's wise to keep log in pages which look exactly the same as every other website. CSS Frameworks often come with designed buttons to help get this work done.
  
Your objective is to create a sign up for using a CSS framework of your choice. If you are struggling for ideas, use Bootstrap as it is the most popular.
  
### Notes
  
* The website doesn't actually need to sign users up - it's just a project to test out the power of CSS frameworks. That being said, a little bit of JS knowledge can help.

## Requirements
  
* Your sign up form must have three Input forms: Username, Email Address and Password.
* Your sign up form must have one button that says Sign Up
* Your sign up form must be centered in the screen so it's obvious to the user and right in front of them.

Assign it to the Button,Take the output of the function and print it somewhere on the user's screen",Javascript,"# Dollars To Cents

Converting dollars to cents would enable you to practice your fundamental knowledge of programming. Loops, if conditions and a simple algorithm will be used.
Your task is to let the user input a dollar value (float), assuming that it can also accept extra cents (ex. $2.75), and convert it into an integer (in this case, if $2.75 = 275). After this, convert into coins with the sub-type of dollars: penny, nickel, dime and quarter. Use an algorithm that would divide the dollar value to the four coin types, and output few coins as possible.

The challenge: Try this without using any frameworks.

(EX. If you have $0.58, I would have 4 coins: 2 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel and 3 pennies)

## Requirements

* There should be two endpoints: /dollar and /cents
* User can send a dollar value to the /dollar endpoint 
* User can see the total cents from the converted dollar value

## Bonus features

* User can see how many were pennies, nickels, quarters and dimes from the total cents

Objective: The goal is to quickly and accurately convert the document to the desired format as selected by the user.
Data is everywhere around us and therefore we feel the need to convert this data into many formats from time to time. If you are a student or a working professional you must have come across the need to convert a document to pdf or excel to a word document or any other format. That’s what AWS Lambda is for.AWS Lambda allows us to develop an application that can convert documents from one format to the other very easily and conveniently. 
The CloudConvert API can be use to automatically convert all files, added to a specific S3 bucket. 
Here is how the process works:
1. User will upload their Office Document to the S3 bucket.
2. Now, the Lambda function will be triggered by the S3 bucket with uploaded files details.
3. Lambda function will convert documents with LibreOffice.
4. Lambda function will upload PDF to S3 Bucket after conversion.
5. After uploading you can also write additional code to update details in the Database.
